The electoral college is not bad. We are a nation of states. That is a bedrock principle of American government. It is fitting then that the election of the president is done through a state by state electoral college. This system has the added benefit of giving smaller states a say, rather than having national politics decided by the largest cities, which have different interests. 

Political gridlock is bad? Nope. It is good. Single party rule is bad. It should be difficult and require coalition to pass legislation. If different parties cannot agree on something, then they don’t take action and change things. We stay in the status quo. Want your legislation to pass? Then advance legislation that is popular among the states. 

The author’s example of courts becoming political was the overturning of Roe v Wade. Ironic that the author finds the decision overturning Roe to be political, but not Roe itself, a decision that created rights not found in the constitution or any law. In any event, limiting government overreach is what the courts should do. They are not lawmakers and declaring unconstitutional acts to be unconstitutional is not politics.",201

This is declaring the NYT to be a domestic enemy in regards to that oath. ",2
Ser_Tinnley,t3_1f64psv,1725203814,"We are dangerously close to having an autocracy. We have the media that exists to completely serve ""The Party,"" and on top of that ""The Party"" has repeatedly attempted to jail its political opponent. Then when that failed, ""The Party"" tried to have him killed.  ""The Party"" repeatedly fights against measures that would bolster the integrity of the electoral process. And now we have ""The Party"" now saying you cannot question it. 

This is truly the stuff of third-world dictatorships. How long until major critics of the government start disappearing in the middle of the night, never to be heard from again?",10
Lifeisagreatteacher,t3_1f6gng9,1725203852,"People don’t think about the censorship on search engines. Try to find anything that questions vaccines, clinical studies that refute vaccines, refutes climate change, etc. It’s not just politics, it’s everything to censor anything that provides an opposing view to propaganda that is implemented by those that want to control the population. The only place you can get real information is then dismissed as “Right Wing” sites.",41
Txstyleguy,t3_1f6anoh,1725203889,Well it’s the NYT so no surprise. They’re not even trying to hide their contempt for the Constitution and rule of law anymore. We’re living on a very slippery slope folks.,2
tsoxiko,t3_1f6anoh,1725203939,"There are penalties….its libel,but for some reason the media “as a whole” is protected from prosecution of libelous activity…

Freedom of the press held a different meaning in the early years,it was just assumed that press members would be outstanding individuals sworn to the concept of uncovering both truth and lies within government entities when it was written,however now,we have immoral script readers that are nothing more than faces on tv attempting to have their faces recognized across a bigger spectrum of the audience to inflate their ego’s and market worth in order to get better gigs..

We watch actors portraying a newscast ladies and gents,it’s all scripted for your enjoyment..and the news companies marketshare..

Freedom of the press is very important but my opinion,should be modified in such a way that would prevent dishonest reporting under the threat of actual consequences….for what they do,if any of us did the same,would be sued into oblivion for libel.",15
